    2) Root split to create tree with >=3 levels
    3) ~~Range Query~~
    4) ~~K-NN Query~~
    5) ~~Skyline Query~~
    6) Proper messages during the build of the tree, since it needs some time.  
       E.g.:  
       ```
       Block 1: maximum number of nodes reached
       Block 1: Split
       Block 2: maximum number of nodes reached
       Block 2: Reinsert
       Block 3: maximum number of nodes reached
       Block 3: Reinsert
       Block 3: Split
       ```
